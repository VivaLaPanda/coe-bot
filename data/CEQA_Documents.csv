Historically, the Facility experienced two 10-year, El Niño winter storm events in 1982 and 2014 that resulted in mass flooding, compromising essential operations, such as access and safety. Damage and defects to the stormwater and sanitary sewer system, caused by devaluation due to use, will likely fail within the next five to 10 years and would not be readily available to function in the next 10-year storm event, and therefore, disruptions to critical Facility operations would be imminent. The Storm Drain Systems Improvements Project would prevent safety and access concerns in order to maintain services essential to the public health, safety, and welfare of approximately two million people that the Facility serves.

On October 19, 2021, in an additional Emergency Proclamation, Governor Newsom stated that as 2021 continued, “sustained and extreme high temperatures have increased water loss from reservoirs and streams, increased demands from communities and agriculture, and further depleted California’s water supplies,” expanded the scope of the Emergency Proclamation statewide, and maintained his earlier orders and their provisions in full force and effect. The October 2021 Emergency Proclamation directs the Department of Water Resources (DWR), State Water Resources Control Board, Office of Emergency Services, and the Office of Planning and Research to assist local agencies in identifying acute drinking water shortages in domestic water supplies, and work with those local agencies to implement solutions to those water shortages to proactively prevent situations where a community runs out of drinking water. On March 28, 2022, Governor Newsom issued an additional Emergency Proclamation maintaining the May and October 2021 proclamations in full force and effect. On March 18, 2022, DWR submitted an application for a minor amendment to the ITP for Long-term Operations of the State Water Project ITP (ITP No. 2081-2019-066-00, SWP ITP) requesting changes to Condition of Approval 8.12. DWR’s requested changes would establish a meet and confer process if larval Delta Smelt are detected at Station 716 from April 1 – June 30, 2022. If larval Delta Smelt are observed at Station 716 between April 1 – June 30, 2022, DWR and CDFW would establish a maximum diversion rate at the Barker Slough Pumping Plant (BSPP) that would allow customers of the North Bay Aqueduct to maintain basic human health and safety standards and drinking water supplies. On April 1, 2022 CDFW issued an amendment to the SWP ITP that 1) modifies Condition of Approval 8.12 as requested by DWR, 2) modifies Condition of Approval 9.1.1 to require DWR to restore an additional 4.95 acres of Delta Smelt tidal wetland habitat to offset impacts associated with increases in BSPP exports in Water Year 2022, and 3) modifies portions of ITP Attachment 1, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, to be consistent with amendments to Conditions of Approval 8.12 and 9.1.1.

2022040001,Coachella Valley Water District,,CVWD,"North Shore, Dale Kiler, and Booster Station Replacements Project ",NOE,4/1/2022,4/1/2022,"CVWD proposes to replace approximately five miles of existing deteriorating pipelines in the North Shore and Dale Kiler Road areas.  The pipelines associated with both project components (North Shore and Dale Kiler) were installed approximately 28 years ago and have experienced water main leaks in the past several years.  These leaks are due to corrosion and often result in an interruption of water services to customers during repairs.  The associated Booster Stations (7101, 7102, and 7990) are also in need of replacement.

The North Shore project component includes replacement of 13,150 linear feet of domestic water mains with 24-inch, 12-inch, and 10-inch diameter ductile iron pipe (DIP) and associated appurtenances.  The existing asbestos cement (AC) pipeline includes 4-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch diameter water mains in need of replacement to upgrade the deteriorated transmission main.  The replacement pipeline will be installed in a previously disturbed area within the public street right-of-way.  The replacement project involves excavating to a maximum depth of 12 feet within CVWD's right-of-way to allow for placement of the new DIP pipeline.  Trenchless pipe installation techniques are planned where the 12-inch water main along Bay Drive crosses under the existing railroad tracks. CVWD will abandon-in-place and slurry cement-fill the old existing AC pipelines. Construction duration is expected to last approximately 6 months.

The Dale Kiler project component includes replacement of corroded DIP and appurtenances within Dale Kiler Road and in nearby streets in the unincorporated community of Mecca.  The purpose of the project is to replace approximately 13,600 linear feet of existing 8-inch and 12-inch DIP domestic water mains with new polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe.  The replacement pipeline will be installed in a previously disturbed area within the public street right-of-way.  Excavation of the pipeline trench would be approximately 13,600 feet long to a maximum depth of 11 feet below ground surface and approximately 3 feet wide within Dale Kiler Road; segments of nearby 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Streets; Frank J. Valdovino Road; and Pie de la Cuesta, Thunderbird, Mecca II and Mecca III apartment complexes. Construction duration is expected to last approximately 6 months.

The BS replacements includes the construction of new concrete pads and structures adjacent to the existing Booster Station’s 7101, 7102, and 7990.  The structures would contain new vertical turbine pumps and generators.  Upgrades to the existing Motor Control Centers at each BS site are also proposed. Construction and staging would occur at each BS site and the project is expected to last approximately 6 months.

Cultural resources studies were prepared for the Project in 2021.  The Project would not have a significant effect on historical or archaeological resources and would have no effect on historic properties under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.  The Project would implement a standard practice for the unanticipated discovery of cultural resources during project development and would also adhere to regulations regarding the unanticipated discovery of human remains.

Biological resources memoranda were prepared for the Project in 2021. Three special-status plant species and four special-status wildlife species were found to have low to moderate potential to occur within the Project sites; none of these species were observed during the field surveys.  The Project is not located within any federally designated critical habitat area and is not located within or immediately adjacent to a conservation area associated with the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan and Natural Community Conservation Plan (CVMSHCP/NCCP).  CVWD would implement standard practices necessary for compliance with California Fish and Game Code Section 3503, California Fish and Game Code Section 3503.5, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which would minimize potential temporary construction-related impacts on nesting birds that may be present within the APEs during the bird nesting season.

Air quality technical memoranda were prepared for all project components and present the emissions of criteria pollutants from construction and operation.  Emissions for each individual project component are below the federal de minimis levels and the maximum annual combined emissions from all project components are also below the de minimis levels.  The project components are therefore exempt from a conformity decision.

The project reach is deeply incised, resulting in reduced connectivity with its floodplain for the majority of the channel length. The channel and overall site conditions make the area suitable for restoration of a multi-threaded channel with extensive floodplain inundation. The design will bring the current channel back to its original grade and provide the contours for natural establishment of an anastomosing network of channels. A complex mosaic of channels, wetlands and uplands is expected to provide more diverse plant and wildlife habitat, allow for greater infiltration and storage of water, and result in a greater likelihood of sustaining wetlands into the future. The process will reconnect the channel to the surrounding floodplain and increase the duration of the seasonal water table in the adjacent floodplains and seasonal wet meadows.

The proposed project will restore the habitat located at Lakeville Creek by:
1. Grading throughout the project reach to replace the incised channel with a broad “Stage Zero” wetland complex with no defined channel; grading will consist primarily of excavation in the upper project reach and fill in the lower reach.

2022040034,South Coast Air Quality Management District,,,Proposed Rule 1147.2 – NOx Reductions from Metal Melting and Heating Furnaces,NOE,4/1/2022,4/1/2022,"Proposed Rule (PR) 1147.2 has been developed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and limit carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from metal melting furnaces, metal heat treating furnaces, and metal heating and forging furnaces which require a South Coast AQMD permit at RECLAIM, former RECLAIM, and non-RECLAIM facilities. PR 1147.2 defines applicable equipment categories, updates NOx emission limits, and establishes a new CO limit. PR 1147.2 also includes compliance schedules with transition emission limits as well as provisions for monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping, and exemptions from specific provisions. To achieve the proposed NOx emission limits according to the compliance schedule set forth in PR 1147.2, the following physical changes are anticipated to require minimal construction activities, with most occurring in the first three years but lasting up to 35 years after PR 1147.2 is adopted: 1) approximately 62 burners may be replaced with Ultra Low NOx Burners (ULNBs) or Low NOx Burners (LNBs); 2) one new selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system with one new ammonia storage tank may be installed; and 3) two existing SCR systems may be modified. For all other units subject to PR 1147.2, the affected equipment would be either replaced or modified at the end of their useful life, or will qualify for an exemption from the emission limits if the NOx emissions are less than one pound per day. Upon full implementation, the proposed project is expected to achieve 0.5 ton per day of NOx emission reductions.",https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/2022040034,Proposed Rule 1147.2 – NOx Reductions from Metal Melting and Heating Furnaces,Kevin Ni,South Coast AQMD,Air Quality Specialist,kni@aqmd.gov,21865 Copley Dr,,Diamond Bar,CA,91765,9093962462,,,"Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino","Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,15061(b)(3),"South Coast AQMD, as Lead Agency, has reviewed the proposed project pursuant to: 1) CEQA Guidelines Section 15002(k) – General Concepts, the three-step process for deciding which document to prepare for a project subject to CEQA; and 2) CEQA Guidelines Section 15061 – Review for Exemption, procedures for determining if a project is exempt from CEQA. The analysis of the anticipated physical changes that may occur if the proposed project is implemented combined with the timing of compliance distributed over several years indicates that the construction emissions are expected to be minimal, and over time, will be offset by corresponding NOx emission reductions as each unit is either modified or replaced and operating. Thus, it can be seen with certainty that implementing the proposed project would not cause a significant adverse effect on the environment. Therefore, the proposed project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) – Common Sense Exemption.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The hazardous substances at the site pose a risk to human health and ecological receptors, and the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and The Boeing Company (Boeing) have agreed that removal actions are necessary to mitigate the release or threatened release of these substances from the site. Boeing’s removal actions will bring site lead levels below the high toxicity reference ecological risk-based screening level for lead, which is significantly more protective of human health than required. The removal actions will also permit the MRCA to reopen closed portions of popular Sage Ranch Park trails to recreational users following DTSC review and approval of the cleanup.

Releases of hazardous substances are threatened to occur from increasingly frequent and severe precipitation events in the Ventura County area. Additionally, because the shooting range clay pigeon debris which remains at the site burned in a previous fire, it is brittle and more vulnerable to rapid disintegration and transport via surface water runoff. The remaining lead shot may also be acutely toxic to granivorous bird specifies, which use grit to help digest their food and may mistake shot for pebbles and ingest them. Lastly, recreators eager to utilize the Sage Ranch Park Loop Trail frequently trespass onto closed portions of the trail, resulting in potential exposure to hazardous substances at the site.
In light of the above, DTSC has determined that future releases of hazardous substances from the Site are threatened to occur in light of predicted changes to regional weather patterns due to climate change and the risk of deferring action through another rainy season is unacceptable. If the rainy season starts before the cleanup is completed, best management practices (BMPs) will be used to prevent migration of contaminated soils. Given DTSC’s determination that an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment exists, this removal action is exempt under the Emergency provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This project is exempt under Section 15061(b)(3) because:
The Blythe landfill is comprised of 365 total acres, of which 335 are permitted for landfill activities. The Project proposes to increase the existing permitted disturbance area by 1.0 acre from 335 acres to 336 acres to accommodate space for the relocation of the metal recycling yard. The Blythe landfill already contains a metal recycling yard within the permitted disturbance landfill area. The relocation of the metal recycling yard would allow for the gate fee attendant to monitor the use of the metal yard to ensure proper use and orderly unloading of metal recycling materials by customers.  The 1-acre proposed to be included to the total permitted disturbance area is within a 30-acre area of land recently purchased by RCDWR. The land was formerly utilized by the previous owner and shows signs of land disturbance, including soil stockpiles and does not contain any natural drainages or other biological features. Furthermore, the Project site is surrounded by the landfill to the north and east and by farmland to the southwest with no sensitive receptors in any direction. The use of the 1-acre area for ancillary uses would not have a direct, indirect, or cumulatively significant effect on the environment.  The Project would not have an effect on environmental resources, as such the Project meets the scope and intent of Section 15061(b)(3), General Rule Exemption.  

Based upon the entire record, the Project would not result in the potential for any significant effect on the environment. This determination is an issue of fact and sufficient evidence exists in the record that the activity will not have a significant effect on the environment. As such, the exemption applies and no further evaluation under CEQA is required. See Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Comm’n (2007) 41 Cal. 4th 372.  

Section 15301, Existing Facilities 
Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency’s determination. 

This project is exempt under Section 15306 because:
The Project proposes to increase the existing permitted disturbance area by 1.0 acre from 335 acres to 336 acres to accommodate the relocation of the metal recycling yard. The space allocated for the metal recycling yard within the 1-acre area would be negligible. The negligible use of the 1-acre for operations already occurring (metal and mattress recycling) at the existing facility would not have a direct, indirect, or cumulatively significant effect on the environment. As such, the Project is found not to affect any environmental resources; therefore, the Project meets the scope and intent of Section 15301, Categorical Exemption.  

Section 15304, Minor Alterations of Land
Class 4 consists of minor public and private alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except  for forestry or agricultural purposes. 

This project is exempt under Section 15304 because:
The Project proposes to increase the existing permitted disturbance area by 1.0 acre from 335 acres to 336 acres for a concrete pad to accommodate the relocation of the metal recycling yard. The concrete pad for the metal recycling yard within the 1.0 acre area would involve minor alterations of land, namely grubbing and minor grading for pad preparation. The area planned to be disturbed does not contain any healthy, mature, or scenic tree for forestry or agricultural purposes. As such, the Project is found not to affect any environmental resources; therefore, the Project meets the scope and intent of Section 15304, Categorical Exemption.  
Section 15311, Accessory Structures
Class 11 consists of construction, or placement of minor structures accessory to (appurtenant to) existing commercial, industrial, or institutional facilities. 

This project is exempt under Section 15311 because:
The Project proposes to increase the existing permitted disturbance area by 1.0 acre from 335 acres to 336 acres to accommodate space for a concrete pad for the relocation of the metal recycling yard. The concrete pad for the metal recycling yard would serve as an accessory structure for an existing permitted landfill and does not propose changes to its current operations as a result construction of the concrete pad.  As such, the Project is found not to affect any environmental resources; therefore, the Project meets the scope and intent of Section 15311, Categorical Exemption.

2022030503,Coachella Valley Water District,,CVWD,Sites Reservoir Project Agreement ,NOE,3/17/2022,3/17/2022,"The Sites Reservoir project objective is to improve California’s water supply and the State Water Project’s (SWP) ability to continue to reliably deliver water south.  The project is included as part of the proposed solutions to the State’s water supply challenges in Governor Newsom’s 2019 Water Resilience Portfolio.  CVWD is a member agency of the SWP contractors.  In recognition of the need to secure additional water supply for the Coachella Valley, CVWD began its membership in the Sites Reservoir project (Sites Project) after the Board authorized Phase 1 participation on January 24, 2017.  CVWD proposes to continue funding as amended to complete the Phase 2 of the project.

The Sites Project currently is sized at 1.5 million acre-feet at an estimated cost of $3.93 billion (B, 2021$) consisting of the following four phases: 
 
•	Phase 1: calendar years (CY) 2015 - 19, Funding/ Proposition 1 Application
•	Phase 2: CY 2019 - 24, Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR), Final Feasibility Report, Permits, Water Rights, Full Operation Analysis, Secure Federal and State Funding, Preliminary Engineering, Land Acquisition 
•	Phase 3: CY 2025 - 26, Right of Way and Final Design 
•	Phase 4: CY 2026 - 32, Construction and Close-Out 
The annual cost for CVWD’s total participation in the project over all phases is estimated to range between $7.6 M to $9.2 M (2021$), contingent on grant funding, which includes debt service and average operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.  CVWD’s contribution to the Phase 2 task is based on CVWD’s participation in SWP deliveries, and the expected water supply delivered by the Sites Reservoir project.  The storage volume allocated to CVWD is 62.3 thousand acre-feet, to be used in a manner that best suits the organization’s needs.  CVWD has determined 10 thousand acre-feet annually is appropriate.  It is anticipated that 36 months are needed to complete the Phase 2 work effort (January 2022 to December 2024).
Additional tasks to be completed in Phase 2 to narrow the range and provide for more accurate costs include:

•	Continue to secure Federal and State Funding
•	Complete Final EIR/Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
•	Obtain environmental permits required for WSIP final award
•	Advance engineering of project feature encroachments to 65% design level (in support of permitting)
•	Complete preliminary engineering (30% design level) and Phase 1A/1B of Geotechnical Investigations
•	Execute final operations agreement with Facility Partners, and Federal and State Agencies 
•	Receive Water Right Order and Permit
•	Develop Mitigation Acquisition Master Plan
•	Develop Land Acquisition Master Plan and ROW Manual
•	Land Acquisition Planning

2022030425,North Coast County Water District,,,Sheila Tank Replacement Project  ,NOE,3/15/2022,3/15/2022,"The North Coast County Water District (NCCWD or District) proposes to replace a water tank (Sheila Tank) located off of Sheila Lane in the City of Pacifica. Sheila Tank was built in 1955, has reached the end of its useful life, and currently is out of service. The original Sheila Tank, constructed of redwood, has a volume of about 100,000 gallons, or 0.1 million gallons (MG). According to District records the existing tank is 13-feet high by 32-feet in diameter (these dimensions suggest an actual storage volume of less than 80,000 gallons). The Sheila Tank Replacement Project (proposed project) will include the demolition of the existing tank and the addition of a prestressed concrete replacement tank which will be partially buried and have a capacity of 0.6 MG and feature associated valves, vault, piping, power and other site improvements. See Figure 3 for the Final Grading and Paving Plan; See Appendix A for the full 100% Design Plans Package. The new concrete Sheila Tank would have an inside diameter of 55-feet, an outside diameter of 57-feet, a side water depth of 34-feet, and a 28-foot height above finished grade (Appendix B - Basis of Design Report). Partially burying the tank 5-feet below lowest adjacent grade will not only minimize the visual impact for surrounding neighbors but also reduce costly foundation enhancements in event of seismic activity (Appendix B). The projected design inlet and outlet flows to the tank will be 1,200 gallons per minute (gpm) for peak hour demand and 320 (gpm) for average day demand (Appendix B). The NCCWD is both the project applicant and CEQA Lead Agency.

As mentioned above, Sheila Tank has reached the end of its useful life and currently is out of service. The District has determined that the tank is no longer viable with its current capacity, it holds inadequate fire protection storage, cannot supply peak demands, and is seismically deficient. The existing tank is leaking, not anchored, and vulnerable to seismic events. The proposed project would replace the existing deteriorating tank to meet current standards of public health and safety, and would increase the size of the tank to address a storage deficit and a need for improved fire suppression in the area served by the tank. Discharge water flow rates would remain the same regardless of the increased tank size.  The proposed project would not increase the capacity of the water system, as the pipeline connecting to the tank would not be increased.  The proposed project would merely increase the storage volume to help meet existing daily demand as well as increase water storage for fire suppression. Sheila Tank currently services an area of approximately 265 acres that includes approximately 1,410 service connections, and also assists an additional zone which contains an additional 760 service connections.  The service area and number of residences served would remain unchanged under the proposed project.

The replacement water tank would be located at the same site as the existing deteriorating structure. Discharge water flow rates would remain the same regardless of the increased tank size.  Therefore, the proposed project would not increase the capacity of the water distribution system, as the pipeline connecting the tank to the existing system would be replaced but not increased in size.  An increase in capacity would require increasing the size of the water delivery pipes leading from the tank.  The new water tank would service the same area and number of residences as the current structure, and would not support future growth.  The proposed project would merely increase the storage area to help meet existing daily demand as well as increase water storage for fire suppression.  Therefore, the project is consistent with the example provided in 15302(c), as the replacement of the water tank would result in no expansion of capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The company is hoping that a groundwater well can prove to be an integral part of our water supply during times of drought. The health and safety of the community is dependent on having a reliable second source of water during a drought. The project is considered an emergency prevention measure that will prevent an imminent water outage due to ongoing drought conditions on the site’s primary source of water (Mill Creek).

On March 5, 2021, the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture designated 50 California counties, including Sonoma County, as primary natural disaster areas due to drought. This Secretarial disaster designation makes farm operators eligible to be considered for certain assistance from the Farm Service Agency. On April 21, 2021, Governor Newsom issued a Proclamation of a State of Emergency in Sonoma and Mendocino counties due to drought conditions in the Russian River Watershed (Governor's Drought Proclamation). The Governor has continued that proclamation for Sonoma and Mendocino counties through further drought proclamations on May 10, July 8, and October 19, 2021. On April 27, 2021, the Board of Supervisors for the County of Sonoma proclaimed a local emergency for the Sonoma County Operational Area due to drought conditions, which was most recently continued on March 1, 2022. On June 16, 2021, the General Manager of Sonoma Water determined that due to drought conditions, an emergency exists that poses a clear and imminent danger, requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of life, health, property, or essential public services, necessitating immediate action pursuant to the authority of the County of Sonoma Resolution #06-0649. On June 18, 2021, the Sonoma Water Board of Directors adopted a resolution ratifying the General Manager’s emergency determination and declaring the need to do emergency work related to drought and that such projects are exempt for the requirements of CEQA. The Board of Directors has since continuously renewed the emergency determination every two weeks.

Sonoma Water staff are proposing work necessary to bring an existing groundwater well at the Sebastopol Road Well Station into operation and to increase regional and community drought resiliency. CEQA Guidelines Section 15301 provides, generally, that the operation of existing facilities involving negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the lead agency's determination is categorically exempt from CEQA. Item b exempts existing facilities, including public utility services. Item f, specifies that health protection devices for use in existing facilities are exempt under CEQA.

improvements along Apache Avenue from the US 50 / State Route 89 intersection,
to the Lake Tahoe Environmental Science Magnet School.
The following mobility improvements are proposed for Apache Avenue, including a
‘class 1’ shared-use path (a separate trail for non-motorized travel); a sidewalk on
the opposite side of the street; maintain ‘class 2’ bike lanes within the Apache
Avenue Right of Way; pedestrian-friendly enhancements such as Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) curb ramps, crosswalks, speed feedback signs, and high
visibility pavement markings; and water quality improvements such as curb and
gutter, sediment capturing structures at inlets, storm drains, channel reinforcement
at storm drain outlets, and revegetation of areas disturbed by project construction.
The project would build upon the Meyers Bikeway project (trail constructed to
connect Meyers and South Lake Tahoe) and would provide critical mobility
improvements to Apache Avenue. The project also supports the Linking Tahoe:
Active Transportation Plan (TMPO, March 2016) and is included on TRPA’s
Environmental Improvement Program (EIP) list as a Transportation Program project
(#03.02.02.0006) that once constructed, will help improve air quality as a result of
trail network connectivity and mobility improvements.
Finally, the project is also within one of the high priority watersheds for pollutant
load delivery to Lake Tahoe; proposed improvements such as curb/gutter, channel
enforcements, revegetation, and sediment capture will also reduce fine sediment

The gas produced by the proposed anaerobic digester will either be; cleaned onsite using gas upgrading equipment and trucked offsite daily, connected via underground pipeline to a common biogas upgrading facility that services a cluster of dairies, connected to a utility grid natural gas pipeline for injection, or utilized onsite to generate electricity through the use of a generator such that the electricity produced can be sold and delivered through the existing electrical grid. The digestion system would be installed within the existing dairy footprint and will digest cow manure produced at the dairy. Process combinations for the digestion systems may include up to four (4) unique anaerobic digester tanks. All combinations will also include the construction of one (1) equalization tank, up to two (2) sludge storage tanks, miscellaneous ancillary equipment, a proposed gas upgrading area, and a proposed truck loading area. All options may also include the construction of up to two (2) aerobic digester tanks, an algae raceway for wastewater treatment, up to two (2) emergency flares and up to four (4) gas-fired process heaters. SJVAPCD permits will be procured for all necessary permit units. The phased aerobic wastewater treatment system operation is an aerobic system which processes the effluent after the anaerobic digestion system. When the effluent is cycled out of the anaerobic digestion it flows into the aerobic reactor to be oxygenated and aerobically digested. In the process, this reduces the nitrogen concentration of the water. In the future, salt treatment and removal equipment may be installed, with provisions to export the brine to an approved disposal facility via pipeline or truck. The digester tanks may be heated to optimize efficiency. One to three (1 to 3) trucks per week of fuel gas may be brought in for heating purposes. The facility will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Most of the time, it will be remotely monitored. During the initial startup period and during maintenance operations, there may be 2-3 onsite employees, mostly during the daytime.

There are no pedestrian facilities (curb ramps, sidewalks, bicycle lanes) within the project limits. There is an existing drainage culvert structure located beneath the southbound offramp that will not be impacted by the proposed project.
The existing southbound offramp has one through-lane and one free right turn lane with a channelized median. The southbound offramp will be widened up to approximately 16-feet to accommodate two (2) through lanes, a dedicated right turn lane, and an 8-foot shoulder. The channelized median will be removed, which will improve safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.

This project is an integral part of the District’s landscape strategy aimed at protecting Trinity County communities from future catastrophic wildfire events and returning the landscape to a healthy, less hazardous state. Fuel Reduction treatments will be strategically implemented along roadsides and adjacent to habitable structures and critical infrastructure to protect the life and property of residents of Lewiston as well as to provide safe evacuation routes and ease of firefighter access and suppression efforts. The project area includes portions of many different private landowners within the WUI, and our objective is to treat approximately 10-100 acres over a 3-5 year period. Topography is mostly gentle (15%-45%) throughout much of the project area and elevations range from approximately 1800’-2200’.  

The prescription includes hand thinning of small diameter (less than 10” DBH) conifers and shrubs that are adjacent to habitable structures, critical infrastructure, and/or roadways and driveways. Emphasis will be placed on eliminating the continuity of surface and ladder fuels. Some sub canopy trees may be removed to break up vertical continuity to dominant trees as well as to raise the canopy base height, which will reduce future fire intensity. Cut materials will bucked and carried to the chipper whenever feasible and then chipped and broadcasted on site. Any remaining material that cannot be chipped will be lop-and-scattered on site.

Findings of Fact: The proposed project is the establishment of a retail store in an
existing structure, which is currently being used for retail. The new use will not involve
the use of significant amounts of hazardous substances. The structure is less than
10,000 square feet in floor area on a site zoned for the proposed use. All necessary
public services and facilities are already in place servicing the existing use. The site is
located in an urban environment completely surrounded by existing urban uses and the surrounding area is not environmentally sensitive. 

The proposed project is consistent with the applicable General Plan designation and all applicable General Plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations as it is proposed for a retail use, which is consistent with the Commercial General Plan Land Use Designation and is allowed by the M-NC/TC Mixed Use District Neighborhood Commercial/Thoroughfare Commercial zoning. The use is proposed for a site within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. As the site is already completely surrounded by urban uses and currently already completely developed, the project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. There is no evidence in the record that replacing the current retail use with the proposed retail use would result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality given that the site is already used for retail purposes in a commercial area. The site is already served by all required utilities and public services. The proposal includes no expansion of the existing structure and there are no similar projects proposed to be located in the same area. The site is no listed as an historic resource and there are no historic resources adjacent thereto.

Based upon the above and the record as a whole it can be seen with certainty that that there is no possibility that the activity permitted herein will have a significant effect on the environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,
